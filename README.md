# TicTacToe
Developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. The app features a responsive 3×3 game board, turn-based gameplay, win/draw detection logic, and a reset mechanism for starting new games. Implemented clean state management to track player turns and game progress while following Apple’s UI/UX guidelines. Focused on simple, intuitive user interaction and maintainable code structure.
